Project Snapshot: Making Consumer Goods Data Work! ðŸš€  In my Consumer Goods project, I used tools like SQL and Power BI to understand data easily. I turned complex info into simple pictures and videos with PowerPoint and Clipchamp. The goal? Help our team make smarter decisions. Thanks, Codebasics, for this data adventure!
